# Reinforcement Learning


The course provides both basic and advanced knowledge in reinforcement learning across three core skills: theory, implementation, and evaluation. Students will learn the fundamentals of both tabular reinforcement learning and deep reinforcement learning, and will gain experience in designing and implementing these methods for practical applications.

# Coursework 

Coursework 1: The focus of this Coursework is the resolution of a Maze environment, illustrated in Figure 1 and
model as a Markov Decision Process (MDP). In this illustration, the black squares symbolise obstacles,
and the dark-grey squares absorbing states, that correspond to specific rewards. Absorbing
states are terminal states, there is no transition from an absorbing state to any other state.

Coursework 2: Your goal is to train an agent to balance a pole attached (by a frictionless joint) to a moving (frictionless)
cart by applying a fixed force to the cart in either the left or right direction. Please see Fig.
1 for an illustration. The aim is to train the DQN to keep the pole balanced (upright) for as many
steps as possible. We do not control the magnitude of force we apply to the cart, only the direction.
The optimal policy will account for deviations from the upright position and push the cartpole such
that it remains balanced.
